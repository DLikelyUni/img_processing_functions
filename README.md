Matlab functions for image processing

imgQuality.m 
From input processed image and reference image returns values for: MSE, PSNR, global SSIM, PIQE, NIQE, and BRISQUE, as well as the local SSIM map

quantizer.m
From an image, its bit depth, and the desired quantized bit depth, generates a set of levels and codebooks for a linear and lloyd-max quantizer. 

PSNR\_plot.m
For a set of quantised images, repective bit depth, and their reference plots PSNR against the rate of each

downsamp\_rec\_filter\_image.m
For downsampling, reconstructing an input image with options for prefiltering and interpolation filters 

lab1.m
testing of implemented functions.
